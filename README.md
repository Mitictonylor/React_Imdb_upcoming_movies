# Practice
You task is to plan and build an application that displays a list of upcoming film titles, each one linking to their imdb page.


- Draw out the UI on paper, breaking it down into components.
- Draw a component hierarchy diagram, noting down any state and props for each component.
- Implement the application in React.

Note: The ‘View more upcoming releases’ button can link to the imdb calendar page - https://www.imdb.com/calendar/?region=gb
## Available Scripts

In the terminal, at the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
